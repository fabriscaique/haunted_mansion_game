The Haunted Mansion Game

In this game, you find yourself trapped in an eerie, decrepit mansion filled with dark secrets and ghostly inhabitants. Your goal is to survive the supernatural dangers that lurk within and, ultimately, escape with your life. However, the only way out is by navigating the haunted corridors and finding the magical key hidden within the mansion.

Gameplay Overview:
Navigation: As you move through the mansion, you will be presented with choices on where to go. You can either move to the left or to the right. The decisions you make could lead to treasure, dangerous traps, or even ghostly encounters.

Random Events: Every time you choose a path, you may encounter random events:

Sometimes you will stumble upon potions that restore your health.
Other times, you may fall into traps that drain your life points.
Life Points: You start with a limited number of life points (10). If you take too much damage and your life points drop to zero, the game is over, and you will join the mansion's ghostly residents. However, you can heal by using potions found during your exploration.

Ghost Encounters: There is a 50% chance of encountering a ghost while exploring the mansion. If you encounter one, you can choose to fight or flee. Fighting carries the risk of damage, but victory means survival and progress. Fleeing may allow you to escape the ghost, but there’s no guarantee of success, and failure results in injury.

Battles: When battling a ghost, luck plays a crucial role. You may land a hit and defeat the ghost, or your attack might fail, and you will take damage. If you choose to run, your success in escaping will also depend on your luck.

Finding the Key: Defeating ghosts brings you closer to escaping. After defeating a ghost, there’s a 25% chance you’ll find the magic key that will let you leave the mansion. Once you find the key, the game is won, and you are free from the nightmare.

Inventory: You will have a small inventory to carry potions that can heal you. Managing your potions carefully is key to surviving the dangerous events in the mansion.

How to Win:
To win, you must explore the mansion, avoid traps, survive ghost encounters, and eventually find the magical key that allows you to escape. Every decision counts, and your survival will depend on how you manage your resources and navigate the dark corridors.

Good luck—you’ll need it to escape this haunted place
